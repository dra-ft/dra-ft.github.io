# mee.tup v1

Join us for dra.ft **mee.tup** as a follow-up to last week's [code poetry jam](/copojam1).

**mee.tup is more experiments, discussions and ideas around the future of text.**
In this **mee.tup** we collaborate with machines on some quick improv poetry, discuss why it's important to look at computation and poetry together and understand how we can keep growing our community.

**No knowledge of coding required!**

We encourage **womxn poets**, writers, makers, artists, designers and coders to co-author with machines and other humans 👩‍🎤👩‍💻👩‍🎨🦸‍♀️

Saturday (May-23), 6PM-7PM
**Event was streamed on youtube** - [Link](https://youtu.be/qeaeILsn5fk)

We also collaborated on a Google slide 🕶
