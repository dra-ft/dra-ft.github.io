~~DRAFT is a festival that explores the intersections between technology, creative writing and digital natives of India.~~

 ~~The festival~~ dra.ft draws from the idea of poetic computation where the machine and author are collaborators. ~~With a prevalence of digital in our lives we pose the question “Is it possible to write without the Digital?” (Paraphrasing from the artist~~ Taeyoon Choi’s text “[Digital Poetics](http://taeyoonchoi.com/poetic-computation/digital-poetics/)”). 

It is in these intersectional spaces that we can produce, perform and embody new meanings and develop new texts. ~~The festival~~ dra.ft encourages unfinished, work in progress, prototypes, tests (essentially drafts) of texts and text making.
